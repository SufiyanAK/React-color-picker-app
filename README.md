Hey there folks,

Welcome to the **Color Picker App**! It's a fantastic tool that lets you choose any color you like, and it shows it off right there on your screen. It's simple, it's easy, and it's really fun to use.

## How to Use

## What’s Inside

Here’s a quick look at what’s going on behind the scenes:

- **React**: We’re using React to make everything nice and smooth.
- **State Management**: The color you pick is managed using React’s `useState` hook.
- **Components**: There’s a main `ColorPicker` component doing all the heavy lifting.

## Code Breakdown

Here’s what the main code looks like:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function ColorPicker() {
  const [color, setColor] = useState("#FFFFFF");

  function handleColorChange(e) {
    setColor(e.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <div className="color-picker-container">
      <h1>Color Picker</h1>
      <div className="color-display" style={{ backgroundColor: color }}>
        <p>Selected Color: {color}</p>
      </div>
      <label>Select a Color:</label>
      <input type="color" value={color} onChange={handleColorChange} />
    </div>
  );
}
